			<p> Peregrine falcons can be hard to identify because of their quick
				flight and camouflage coloring. The wings and tail are bluish-gray, 
				while the back and head are a darker brown. Sometimes the cheeks can 
				have a dark brown tear-shaped mark. The bird's chin and neck are white,
				and each eye is surrounded by a yellow circle.</p>
